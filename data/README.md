# About this folder

## data

This folder stores the observations structured data, saved under the file `demo-data.json`. The demo file is a simplified and anonymised version of my real life daily changing astronomy data, where my observations and all their metadata are stored.

Think of it as an example data structure that stores a lot of items, which the Client React app and the Server NodeJS/Express apps are mapped to (schema wise) to read, search into, filter, sort, display and generate PDF reports from.

The same principles and interface can be used for different data structures, when the Client and Server apps are updated to reflect on the different data fields.
