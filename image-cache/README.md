# About this folder

## image-cache

This folder stores the cached images (all remote, Internet based image urls from data/demo-data.json are downloaded and stored here by the caching script that runs in the app). I have only pushed in the repo the first 10 cached images, but once the Client and Server apps are running this folder would cache all 772 remote images for performance reasons and to speed up the pdf being generated from local rather than remote assets.
